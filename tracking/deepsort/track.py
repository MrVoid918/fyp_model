    Parameters
    ----------

        `n_init` frames.
    max_age : int
        The maximum number of consecutive misses before the track state is
        set to `Deleted`.
    feature : Optional[ndarray]
        Feature vector of the detection this track originates from. If not None,
        this feature is added to the `features` cache.

    det_class : Optional str
        Classname of matched detection

        Total number of frames since last measurement update.
    state : TrackState
        The current track state.
    features : List[ndarray]
        A cache of features. On each measurement update, the associated feature
        vector is added to this list.
